# Development Documentation

This directory contains development and architectural documentation that was moved during codebase cleanup to improve organization.

## Structure

- **`agents/`** - Agent system documentation and specifications (8 specialized agents)
- **`workflows/`** - Development workflow and spec-workflow system documentation
- **`architecture/`** - System architecture documents and design decisions
- **`commands/`** - Agent workflow commands and automation

## Purpose

These documents represent development planning and agent-based workflows that are not directly used by the current Text Ticker Tool implementation. They have been preserved for reference and potential future development.

## Current Status

The Text Ticker Tool currently operates as a vanilla JavaScript application without requiring the agent system described in these documents. The core application files are:

- `index.html` - UI structure
- `script.js` - P5.js application logic
- `style.css` - Dark theme styling
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project guidance for Claude Code
