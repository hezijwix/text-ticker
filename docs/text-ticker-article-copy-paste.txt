TEXT TICKER TOOL

[HERO IMAGE: Full-width screenshot showing main interface with control panel on left, canvas with animated text on circular/curved path, dark background, approximately 1000x600px]

Text Ticker Tool is a browser-based typography application that enables designers to create sophisticated animated text along both geometric shapes and custom vector paths. It generates dynamic text animations through precise path control—circles, rectangles, or freeform splines—with real-time variable font rendering, smooth animation controls, and professional export capabilities. This approach allows designers to explore kinetic typography and motion design without relying on specialized animation software.

○ INFORMATION

Modes of Operation
Text Ticker Tool includes two main path systems: Shape Mode and Spline Mode.

Shape Mode

Text follows parametric geometric paths with precise mathematical control. The system supports circles (adjustable radius) and rectangles (width, height, corner radius). Characters are distributed evenly along the path regardless of curvature using arc-length parameterization, maintaining consistent spacing and proper rotation. This mode is ideal for creating circular badges, curved headlines, geometric text compositions, and architectural typography.

Spline Mode

Text follows custom vector curves created through interactive point-and-click editing. The system supports both linear interpolation and Catmull-Rom smooth curves with arc-length parameterization for consistent character distribution along any curve complexity. This mode enables organic flowing paths, hand-drawn aesthetics, complex text arrangements, and unlimited creative freedom for experimental typography.

Principle of Arc-Length Parameterization

Rather than spacing characters by parametric intervals, Text Ticker Tool uses arc-length parameterization to ensure uniform visual distribution along any path type. This mathematical approach calculates the actual distance traveled along curves, ensuring consistent spacing regardless of path complexity—tight curves, sharp corners, or varying geometries. The result is professional typography where characters maintain perfect visual rhythm through any path configuration.

Core Controls

Font Weight

Real-time variable font weight transitions from 400 to 800, enabling dynamic typographic expression.

[SPLIT IMAGE: Left side shows text at weight 400 (light), right side shows same text at weight 800 (bold), both on circular paths, approximately 450x350px each]

Character Spacing

Adjusts the distance between characters along the path, allowing compressed or expanded typography.

[SPLIT IMAGE: Left side shows tight spacing (0.95), right side shows wide spacing (1.2), same path size, approximately 450x350px each]

Text Scale

Controls the size of individual characters while maintaining path geometry and spacing relationships.

[SPLIT IMAGE: Left side shows scale 0.5 (small), right side shows scale 1.5 (large), same path size, approximately 450x350px each]

Animation Offset

Creates smooth character-by-character animation along paths, producing flowing ticker effects.
