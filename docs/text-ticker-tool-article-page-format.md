TEXT TICKER TOOL

[VISUAL PLACEMENT #1: Full-width hero image showing the main interface]
- Control panel on left side with Shape/Spline toggle visible
- Canvas showing animated text on circular or curved path
- Clean, minimal interface on dark background
- Text should be mid-animation showing the dynamic capability

### Introduction Paragraph
Text Ticker Tool is a browser-based typography application that enables designers to create sophisticated animated text along both geometric shapes and custom vector paths. It generates dynamic text animations through precise path control‚Äîcircles, rectangles, or freeform splines‚Äîwith real-time variable font rendering, smooth animation controls, and professional export capabilities. This approach allows designers to explore kinetic typography and motion design without relying on specialized animation software.

## INFORMATION SECTION

### Section Header
‚óã INFORMATION

### Collapsible Box with Dark Background

#### Subsection: Modes of Operation
**Modes of Operation**
Text Ticker Tool includes two main path systems: Shape Mode and Spline Mode.

---

#### Subsection: Shape Mode
**Shape Mode**

[VISUAL PLACEMENT #2: Screenshot showing text on circular path]
- Interface showing "Shape Mode" selected
- Control panel displaying Circle Radius, Font Weight slider
- Text arranged in perfect circle with even spacing
- Guides visible showing the geometric structure
- Dimensions: Approximately 900x550px

Text follows parametric geometric paths with precise mathematical control. The system supports circles (adjustable radius) and rectangles (width, height, corner radius). Characters are distributed evenly along the path regardless of curvature using arc-length parameterization, maintaining consistent spacing and proper rotation. This mode is ideal for creating circular badges, curved headlines, geometric text compositions, and architectural typography.

---

#### Subsection: Spline Mode
**Spline Mode**

[VISUAL PLACEMENT #3: Screenshot showing text on custom spline path]
- Interface showing "Spline Mode" selected
- Custom curved path with visible control points
- Text following organic, flowing curve
- Interpolation controls visible (Linear/Catmull-Rom)
- "Clear Spline" button visible in control panel
- Dimensions: Approximately 900x550px

Text follows custom vector curves created through interactive point-and-click editing. The system supports both linear interpolation and Catmull-Rom smooth curves with arc-length parameterization for consistent character distribution along any curve complexity. This mode enables organic flowing paths, hand-drawn aesthetics, complex text arrangements, and unlimited creative freedom for experimental typography.

---

#### Subsection: Principle of Arc-Length Parameterization
**Principle of Arc-Length Parameterization**

Rather than spacing characters by parametric intervals, Text Ticker Tool uses arc-length parameterization to ensure uniform visual distribution along any path type. This mathematical approach calculates the actual distance traveled along curves, ensuring consistent spacing regardless of path complexity‚Äîtight curves, sharp corners, or varying geometries. The result is professional typography where characters maintain perfect visual rhythm through any path configuration.

## CORE CONTROLS SECTION

### Section Header
**Core Controls**

---

### Control: Font Weight
**Font Weight**

Real-time variable font weight transitions from 400 to 800, enabling dynamic typographic expression.

[VISUAL PLACEMENT #4: Split comparison image]

- RIGHT SIDE: Same text on circular path, Font Weight 800 (bold)
- Show control slider in each screenshot
- Dimensions: Two images side-by-side, approximately 450x350px each

---

### Control: Character Spacing
**Character Spacing**

Adjusts the distance between characters along the path, allowing compressed or expanded typography.

[VISUAL PLACEMENT #5: Split comparison image]
- LEFT SIDE: Text with tight spacing (0.95)
- RIGHT SIDE: Same text with wide spacing (1.2)
- Path remains same size to emphasize spacing difference
- Dimensions: Two images side-by-side, approximately 450x350px each

---

### Control: Text Scale
**Text Scale**

Controls the size of individual characters while maintaining path geometry and spacing relationships.

[VISUAL PLACEMENT #6: Split comparison image]
- LEFT SIDE: Text Scale 0.5 (small characters)
- RIGHT SIDE: Text Scale 1.5 (large characters)
- Same circular path size to show scale effect
- Dimensions: Two images side-by-side, approximately 450x350px each

---

### Control: Animation Offset
**Animation Offset**

Creates smooth character-by-character animation along paths, producing flowing ticker effects.

[VISUAL PLACEMENT #7: Three-frame sequence image]
- FRAME 1: Animation Offset 0 (starting position)
- FRAME 2: Animation Offset 0.33 (mid-animation)
- FRAME 3: Animation Offset 0.67 (continued motion)
- Use arrows or motion blur to indicate movement direction
- Dimensions: Three frames arranged horizontally, approximately 300x350px each
